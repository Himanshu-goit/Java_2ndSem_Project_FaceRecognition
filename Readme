# Face Recognition App

A simple Java Swing-based GUI application that simulates face detection and stores user data (name and email) into a MySQL database. This project demonstrates the use of Java GUI, JDBC, and multithreading (via `SwingWorker`), and is designed for easy integration with actual face recognition libraries like OpenCV.
